<h2>Intelligence</h2>
<div id="piechart"></div>
<div id="piechart1"></div>
<p>
    There are multiple intelligences, many ways people have of learning.
    If you want to be an effective learner you should adopt the style that suits you.
</p>
<h3>Visual/Verbal (reading)</h3>
<p>
    learns best when information is presented visually and in a written language format. This type of learner can excel online or in courses which emphasize reading.    If you are a visual/verbal learner you probably prefer the opportunity to read and reflect at your leisure rather than having a face-to-face workshop covering the same materials.
    It is wise to encourage this type of learner to read course materials and mark them up with a highlighter.  Encourage them to write out responses to each learning objective found in the introduction to each lesson.  This will help them remember vital information.
    If your class involves demonstrations such as lab experiments or assembly of equipment, keep in mind that this type of learner may want to "read the instructions" prior to participation.
    Words from the Visual/Verbal Learner:  "When I study, I need a perfectly quiet room. All I want to do is spread out my books and notes and note cards on a big table and methodically go through my study materials until I have the subject matter down. I don’t want any background music on. I can’t stand studying with a partner. I don’t want to talk about what I’m learning; I just want to read and write about it. I’m a Visual/Verbal learner. It seems that I learn best when my brain is inundated with written words. When studying, I like using gel pens and highlighters in six or seven different colors to write information on flashcards. Often, during an exam, I can remember the color of the information I’m trying to recall, and then the color memory triggers the memory of the answer I’m looking for."
</p>

<h3>Visual/Nonverbal (images)</h3>
<p>
   learns best when information is presented visually and in a picture or design format. In a classroom setting, they benefit from instructors who use visual aids such as film, video, maps and charts.  Online they need images and color cues to help them remember information and to retain their full attention.  Repetitive use of the same icons can be very helpful.
    The more visual aids provided, the more likely visual/nonverbal learners are to enjoy your course and succeed. This is especially true when writing instructions.  Visual/nonverbal learners often become impatient with long instructions not enhanced by visual cues.   As much as possible, translate words and ideas into symbols, pictures, and diagrams. You may wish to experiment with Photoshop or Flash.  Both programs can help you develop better graphics and moving images for the web or PowerPoint.
    An important note:  visual/nonverbal learners have often been criticized by "serious" academics because they like pictures and find that they learn more from video presentations than from lectures.  In the current economy, visual/nonverbal learners are poised to succeed in multimedia television and internet ventures, where their natural appreciation of the power of visual imagery is important.
    It must also be acknowledged that serving the needs of the visual/nonverbal learner takes substantially more time.  One cannot simply type out the course materials or give a lecture.  Image creation, video editing, and even use of icons take time and planning.
    Words from the Visual/Nonverbal Learner: "I have this kitchen utensil drawer at home, and it’s packed full of utensils of one kind or the other. I’ve never been able to figure out why my husband can never find what he’s looking for when he opens the drawer. He just rummages around in the drawer and looks distressed because he can’t get his hands on the spatula he’s looking for. Then I walk over, take one look at the drawer, and pick out the spatula quickly and easily. I realized, after taking the Learning Style Survey, that our different experiences have to do with our differing learning styles. I’m a Visual/Nonverbal Learner. I can scan a dense visual field (like my kitchen drawer) and quickly pick out an essential visual design (like the outline of the spatula). My husband, on the other hand, is a Tactile/Kinesthetic Learner. He’s not going to find that spatula until he gets his hands on it-- which is no small feat in a drawer as crammed full of things as our utensil drawer."
</p>

<h3>The Auditory/ Verbal Learner</h3>
<p>
    learns best when information is presented in an oral language format. In a classroom setting they  benefit from listening to lectures and participating in group discussions. They also benefit from obtaining information from audio tape. When trying to remember something, they can often "hear" the way someone told you the information or the way it was repeated out loud. They learn best when interacting with others in a listening/speaking exchange.
    Words from the Auditory Learner: "When I’m taking a test, I can hear in my head the way my girlfriend and I discussed the subject matter when we were studying together. I can hear my girlfriend’s tone of voice; I remember at what point we were laughing. Often it is the auditory memories that I remember first—the tone of voice, the laughing. Then I remember the content of what we were saying, and this gives me the answer I’m looking for on my exam. It’s amazing to me how strong an Auditory Learner I am. I remember loving to listen to my grandfather tell stories when I was little. My brother couldn’t sit still long enough and would always run off before the story was over. But me, I could just listen forever."
</p>
<h3>The Tactile/ Kinesthetic Learner</h3>
<p>
    learns best when physically engaged in a "hands on" activity. In the classroom they benefit from a lab setting where they can manipulate materials to learn new information. Since they learn best when physically active, sitting in a lecture course can be very challenging.
    Encourage these students to stay actively engaged in the material.  You might recommend a field trip to an historical site, museum, concert orcartoon of chemistry experiment other place where they can "experience" what they are learning.  Even a one day observation of a person who works in that field may help them get a "feel" for how the information in your course is relevant to them.
    Words from the Tactile/Kinesthetic Learner:  "When I was little, I could never sit for long periods of time in school, the way the other kids seemed to be able to. I just needed to move my body. I could never understand why we just sat at our desks, looked at the teacher and listened. I wondered why we never seemed to DO anything. I figured I was just a troublemaker, a bad student, and lazy. But now I see it in terms of learning style. I am a Tactile/Kinesthetic learner. I really need to be actively and physically involved when I’m learning, or nothing sinks in. This is a real challenge in college, especially in traditional lecture classes. But I take notes, and I also draw pictures all over my notebook pages—anything to keep my hands busy during lecture. Somehow this helps me stay focused on what the instructor is saying."

<h2>Memory</h2>
<div id="chart_div"></div>
<p>
    While the last chart tells you how to Learn, this one will tell you how to Remember.


    As You can see here, reading seems to be the lest of what the average person remebers,
    probably due to how passive the activity is, there's little to no involment, people tend to just sit there and look at the page,
    or in the age of the 5-minute attention span, not even that. It's all to common that people will read a page and then 3 pages latter
    go, "What did I just read" they realize they're not even reading, just looking at a page, of course we have a hard time remembring
    this over long term, a lot of people tend to forget most of it over short the short term.
</p>
<p>
    While exsplaining it to others is a very active way to do something that involves your brain.
    Instead of just lokking you start trying to understand it in a cetain way that you can dispense the information to others.
    By trying to teach someone else something you, yourself must go over the pattern/material. plus any questions they have
    will force you to recall information and thus gain a better understanding yourself (If the question is good).
